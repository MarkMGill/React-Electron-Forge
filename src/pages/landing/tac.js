                                In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, FlipSetter and Collaborate may link to sites operated by third parties. However, even if the third party is affiliated with FlipSetter and Collaborate communities, both communities have no control over
                                these linked sites, all of which have separate privacy and data collection practices independent of FlipSetter's rules and regulations. These linked sites are only for your convenience and therefore you are accessing them at your own risk. Nonetheless,
                                FlipSetter seeks to protect the integrity of its web site and the links placed upon it, therefore, we encourage feedback of any kind not only for the site, but for other sites we link to as well.
